## ✨ Contest Details
Welcome to Microsoft's **Best Agent Instructions contest** as part of [Microsoft Build 2025](https://build.microsoft.com/home). 

2025 is the year of agents... but to build a powerful agent, we need powerful instructions. 

Agents are developed and become more effective as we provide instructions, knowledge, and skills. This contest focuses on agent instructions. A well-structured set of instructions ensures that an agent understands its role and tasks and how to interact with users. The following are the main components of agent instructions:
* Purpose
* General guidelines, including general directions, tone, and restrictions
* Skills
  
So, what are you waiting for?? **Unleash your creativity, write your best agent instructions, and submit your prompt for a chance to win amazing prizes! 🥳**

The contest is open from May 19 to May 21. The **submission deadline is Wednesday, May 21st at at 12:00pm (noon) PST**. If your submission is received after this deadline, you will not be eligible to win.

## ✍️ How to Submit
